## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're [Freeside](https://freeside.co.uk), the student run Linux user group at the University of Hull under the department of Computer Science.  
We provide help with FOSS, Linux and sysadmin, as well as providing services to societies like [#hullCSS](https://hullcss.org).  
Feel free to contribute to any of our repos, if you need help or have any queries you can chat with us at <https://discord.freeside.co.uk>.  
University of Hull students get access to our lab on campus, and for a list of awesome resources for students check out our [SRL](https://github.com/FreesideHull/StudentResources)
